## Modules Overview

Compose Camera is divided into two primary modules to provide flexibility and separation of concerns.

### `compose-camera-core`

This module contains the platform-independent business logic, data models, and controller implementations. It is responsible for:

- **Hardware Control**: Interacting with CameraX (Android) and AVFoundation (iOS).
- **State Management**: Managing camera state (lens, flash, zoom, etc.).
- **Consistency**: Ensuring unified behavior across platforms.

Use this module directly if you want to implement your own UI or integrate camera functionality into a non-standard view hierarchy.

### `compose-camera-ui`

This module provides the Jetpack Compose / Compose Multiplatform UI components. It depends on `core` and provides:

- **`CameraPreview`**: A ready-to-use Composable that handles the surface provider and preview display.
- **`FocusIndicator`**: Visual feedback for tap-to-focus.
- **`Pinch to Zoom`**: Gesture handling for zoom control.

For most applications, you will use both modules together.
