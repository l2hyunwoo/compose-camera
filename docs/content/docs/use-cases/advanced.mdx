## Custom Preview Implementation

For advanced use cases where you need full control over the view hierarchy or want to use the Core module without the Compose UI components, please refer to the **[Custom Preview Guide](../guides/custom-preview)**.

That guide covers:

- Using `CameraXViewfinder` on Android.
- Using `AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer` on iOS.
