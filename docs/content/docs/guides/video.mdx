# Video Recording

Compose Camera supports high-quality video recording with configurable options.

## Setup

First, ensure your `CameraConfiguration` includes the `VIDEO` capture mode for optimal performance (though `BALANCED` or `IMAGE` may also work depending on the underlying implementation, `VIDEO` is recommended).

```kotlin
val config = CameraConfiguration(
    captureMode = CaptureMode.VIDEO,
    videoQuality = VideoQuality.FHD // 1080p
)
```

## Start Recording

Call `startRecording()` on your `CameraController`. This is a suspend function that returns a `VideoRecording` object representing the active session.

```kotlin
scope.launch {
    try {
        val recording = controller.startRecording()
        // Recording has started
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        // Handle start failure
    }
}
```

## Stop Recording

The `VideoRecording` object has a `stop()` function which returns the result of the session.

```kotlin
scope.launch {
    // ... inside recording scope or stored reference
    val result = recording.stop()

    when (result) {
        is VideoRecordingResult.Success -> {
            println("Video saved to: ${result.uri}") // File URI/Path
            println("Duration: ${result.durationMs}ms")
        }
        is VideoRecordingResult.Error -> {
            println("Recording failed: ${result.exception}")
        }
    }
}
```

## Pause / Resume

Supports pausing and resuming if the platform allows.

```kotlin
recording.pause()
// ...
recording.resume()
```

## Recording Configuration

You can pass a `RecordingConfig` to customized behavior:

```kotlin
// This would be passed to a custom VideoCaptureUseCase if you implement one
// Default implementation uses standard settings
```
